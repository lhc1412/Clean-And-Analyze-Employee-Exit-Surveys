# Clean And Analyze Employee Exit Surveys
In this project, I'll work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. The following questions will be answered:

- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?

### Summary of results
After analysing the data, it can be concluded that the ratio of employees who have been there longer resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction is higher than that of employees who worked for a short period of time.

Further analysis will go on to find out the answer of the second question, Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?
